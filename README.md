# finalproject
hi mr brown this is the final project. Made by Mathieu Beaudry and Marco Amancio

This code will make it so sound frequencies will play depending on the light level of the surrounding environment. Unfortunately, the RGB LED light did not work. We would've probably have implemented it the same way that we implemented the buzzer; inside of the if function.
